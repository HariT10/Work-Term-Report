            <!--<p>Follow the Journey!</p>-->

            <p>During my first co-op work term, I worked as a Web Designer for SACHAYS, a non-profit organization. SACHAYS works on delivering programs that promote the mental and physical well-being of our seniors, youth, and families. 
            </p>

            

            <p>This organization is not related to computing as they have a different purpose, but the work I was doing was related to computing as I was in charge of the website. </p>

            <p>Other than my job as a Web Designer, I would also get invited to events on weekends where I would get to help/volunteer and even have meaningful conversations with community members about the website or life in general. I really enjoyed it.  
            </p>

            <p>Overall, I enjoyed my role as a Web Designer and I liked working for SACHAYS! Below were some of my goals, more about the job role, and final conclusions/acknowledgments.</p>

    <h1>Goals</h1>

</section>


<div class="aboutMe">


    <div class="text1">
        <p>I had a list of important goals I created that are related to the job going into this co-op work term. </p>

        <p><b>1) Take on the initiative to improve the organization's (SACHAYS) website by identifying design, functionality, and accessibility improvements that can benefit the organization and the community. </b></p>

        <p>I wanted to show my leadership and ability to solve problems. Going into this work term, I knew I would be working on a nonprofit organization's website. So, my plan was to create a PDF with notes analyzing the website. The PDF will have possible improvements and changes/fixes for the website. </p>
   
        <p>I think I did very well in completing this goal. Just like in my action plan, I made sure to create a proper PDF list of all the improvements that could be made to the organization's website. I also made sure to get feedback from my supervisor on these ideas.</p>

        <p><b>2) Another goal I had, was to gain deeper knowledge and hands-on experience with the technologies used in the role, including WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Essentially, improving my technical skills.  </b> </p>
        
        <p> My plan was to complete assigned web development and design tasks independently or with support. I dedicated time weekly to explore tutorials or documentation for Avada and WordPress. I practiced applying new knowledge by making live updates to the SACHAYS website and troubleshooting problems. Also, I experimented with adding or editing HTML/CSS code through the theme editor or custom blocks.</p>

        <p>I think I did well on this goal because I consistently completed all my assigned tasks on time. I also felt confident using tools like Avada and WordPress, and I applied minor HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in certain areas to add new functionality to the website. By the end of the term, I was much more comfortable handling technical issues on my own. I realized the importance of taking time to explore and experiment with the tools used on the job, and this is something I plan to carry forward into my next co-op work term.</p>

        <p> <b>3) Another goal I had, was to complete the tasks given to me in a timely and organized manner. This will help me improve my time management skills and working under pressure. </b></p>

        <p>I planned to do this by always using Google Calendar to track deadlines and create subtasks and take notes on all tasks I need to finish.  </p>

        <p>I think I did well on this goal. Whenever I received a task, I made sure to write it down and add any deadlines into my Google Calendar. This helped me complete every task on time and reduced my stress since I always knew exactly when things were due. This is something I will carry into my next co-op work term, as it really helped meet deadlines and complete tasks.         </p>


        <p> <b>4) Another goal I had, was to attend community events and engage in one-on-one conversations with members of the SACHAYS community (seniors, youth, volunteers, and families) to gather feedback on how the website can be improved to better serve their needs. This process will not only improve the website, but also strengthen my communication skills. </b></p>

        <p> I planned to do this by attending SACHAYS community events. By approaching seniors, youth, volunteers, and families, I was able to have a conversation and ask questions like, "Is there anything you wish was easier to find or use on our website?", "What kind of features would you like to be added to the website?", etc.  </p>


        <p>I think I did well in this goal. I made sure to attend community events and have conversations with the seniors, which helped me build more confidence and improve my clarity when speaking with others. I was also able to gather feedback about the website. If I could do it again, I would bring up the website on my phone or laptop and show it to them directly. This would give them the chance to suggest any changes they felt were needed.</p>

    <h1>Job Description</h1>
    <div class="jobT">
        <p>
            My job was to basically work on the organization's website. I would be given things to add, change, or remove from the website. Some of the tasks I needed to do would be small, but others may be big.
            Here are some of the things I had to do:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="job">
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining and updating the website</li>
            <li>Designing new pages/sub-pages</li>
            <li>Creating mock-up design and tests</li>
            <li>Identifying and fixing functionality issues</li>
            <li>Identifying ways to improve the website</li>
            <li>Working on any other website task given to me</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="newText1">
        <p>I also proposed new pages like "Testimonials" and "Volunteer" pages. This was approved by the board, and I was able to design and build the pages.</p>
    
        <p>Some of the skills I needed for this job were understanding of WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also needed good attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and good communication skills.</p>
    
        <p> Most of the skills were learned on the job, but there are some things from my classes that I remembered during this job. Firstly, there is the CIS*1050 (Web Development), where I learned a lot of elements about web development and visual design. </p>
    
        <p>Secondly, it is from my software design classes I have taken (Software Design I/II/III). I remember in these classes how we were taught to always put user experiences and user opinions first whenever making technical decisions. I remembered this concept during the job whenever I would make changes to the website or propose ideas. I even proposed that I talk to community members about ways the SACHAYS website can improve to make their lives easier.</p>

    <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

    <div class="jobtext2">
        <p>Someone I would like to acknowledge is my supervisor/manager, Mahesh Nileshwar. He is the executive director and founder of SACHAYS. He was amazing and a great person to work with. I also want to acknowledge the SACHAYS team, which is also filled with amazing people and made this co-op work term really enjoyable. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <div class="jobtext3">
        <p>This website mentions the company I worked at, the goals I had, and the job I did. The most important takeaway is that it is important to set goals going into a new job or an experience. No matter what or where the job is, it is important to set goals and reflect on those goals. This is because the goals will allow you to grow as a person and gain new skills. The growth and the skills will only help you going forward. Overall, I really enjoyed my job as a Web Designer at SACHAYS. My growth and the skills I learned will help me going into my second co-op work term. </p>
